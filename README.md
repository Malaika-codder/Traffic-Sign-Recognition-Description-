# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Description-
Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN

raffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is a crucial component in modern driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.
This project aims to automatically detect and classify traffic signs from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

We trained the model on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains over 39,000 images across 43 different traffic sign categories.
The model learns to recognize signs such as speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and other regulatory/warning signs, enabling safer and more intelligent transportation systems.
